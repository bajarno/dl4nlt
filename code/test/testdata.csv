Patriots Day Is Best When It Digs Past the Heroism,"Patriots Day, Peter Berg’s new thriller that recreates the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the ensuing manhunt that followed it, is a surprisingly oblique, morally ambiguous movie from a typically straightforward filmmaker. Patriots Day takes an unexpectedly cynical view of the chaos, rash   and bureaucratic infighting that followed the bombing —  the question is whether that was Berg’s intended message. For its grim   running time, the movie celebrates the men on the ground who helped bring the bombers to justice, but it’s the glimpses of something more complicated than jingoism that really linger. The scene that best illustrates this dichotomy comes late in Patriots Day. As the search for one of the bombers, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, intensifies, his brother’s wife Katherine (Melissa Benoist) is brought in for interrogation on her connections to the case. As she asks for a lawyer, protesting that she “has rights,” her steely interviewer (Khandi Alexander) tuts, “Honey, you ain’t got shit. ” It’s a Hollywood line intended to provoke a big cheer from the audience, despite its queasy legal undertones. But the film presents it as just that —  a cheesy line. The questioning goes nowhere, and the interrogator exits with a shrug as the movie notes in its   Katherine was never charged with any crime. Patriots Day is filled with this kind of bluster, but the film’s most compelling moments serve to undercut it. Deepwater Horizon Stays Too Close to the Surface, Working against those more interesting themes is the man at the center of the movie, Boston Police Sergeant Tommy Saunders, a fictional character invented to serve as the audience’s eyes and ears at every major turning point of the attacks. He’s played by Mark Wahlberg, the polestar of Berg’s new genre of   storytelling who has played the mouthy heroes at the center of Lone Survivor (2013) Deepwater Horizon (2016) and now Patriots Day. Unlike those other films, Wahlberg’s character in Patriots Day didn’t really exist, and he often comes across as a bundle of screenwriting clichés. He’s nursing a bum knee and was recently demoted due to insubordination, but somehow is on   terms with every cop, uniformed or otherwise, in the city. When the film is focused on Saunders, as it mostly is, it feels like a straight recreation of a traumatic event that occurred less than four years ago. Berg largely does well to avoid sensationalizing the 2013 bombing, which killed 3 and wounded 264 others, and the subsequent manhunt that claimed the life of a police officer. At no point does Patriots Day feel like a glitzy action movie or a gory piece of horror. The violence of that day is not lingered on, outside of an effort to make its victims feel like real people by depicting snippets of their lives beforehand. Wahlberg, for his part, can’t help but make Saunders feel like a bit of a stereotype he’s a     movie cop in a film that’s otherwise seeking nuance. Saunders, it seems, is supposed to stand in for the generally lovable, belligerent Boston spirit that prevailed in the days after the marathon, and Berg drills that point home far too many times. There are bits that work —  in the immediate aftermath of the bombs, Wahlberg successfully communicates how angry and shaken Saunders is, rather than switching into    hero mode. He does a decent job selling the trauma, but once his hefty attitude returns, Patriots Day snaps back to severe unreality. That’s too bad, since the film is most fascinating when it faithfully conveys the confusion of the days after the bombing, and the   of differing opinions and clashing egos. The FBI, led by    agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon) takes over the case, recreating the blocks attacked with   bombs inside a gigantic warehouse and combing through surveillance videos for clues. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman) Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick (Michael Beach) and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino (Vincent Curatola) gather there to offer their own guidance on the case. Saunders is present too, for some reason, mostly providing expertise on the businesses around Boylston Street. The thorny, mucky,   debates that played out during the manhunt are the best parts of the film. Berg accurately shows DesLauriers agonizing over whether to release the pictures of the Tsarnaev brothers gleaned from surveillance cameras before he’s fully substantiated that they’re the bombers his hand is eventually forced by a leak to the media. That sets into action the series of events that led to a deadly shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers in Watertown (J. K. Simmons plays a police sergeant there). Berg is wise to delve into the utter chaos of that manhunt, which included a brief, informal declaration of martial law and a bizarre, bloody standoff with the brothers that saw them lobbing pipe bombs at cop cars. It’s bedlam, in other words —  total disorder and madness, the kind of violence and fear that terrorism is intended to provoke, even from those trying to stop it. The Boston PD’s efforts to capture the Tsarnaev brothers is justly depicted as heroic, but it’s the crazed   the random chains of events, and the empty, angry posturing that stick out as most worthy of analysis. If Berg had dug deeper, he could have had a great film on his hands as it stands, he’s delivered a rote, but occasionally   misfire."
A Break in the Search for the Origin of Complex Life,"In Norse mythology, humans and our world were created by a pantheon of gods who lived in the realm of Asgard. As it turns out, these stories have a grain of truth to them. Thanks to a team of scientists led by Thijs Ettema, Asgard is now also the name of a large clan of microbes. Its members, which are named after Norse gods like Odin, Thor, Loki, and Heimdall, are found all over the world. Many of them are rare and no one has actually seen them under a microscope. But thanks to their DNA, we know they exist. And we know that they are singularly important to us, because they may well be the group from which we evolved. If Ettema is right, then around two billion years ago, an Asgardian microbe (or an incredibly close relative) took part in a unique event that gave rise to the eukaryotes. That’s the group which includes humans, our fellow animals, plants, fungi, and every living thing made from large, complex cells —  all the living things we’re most familiar with, and all the ones we can actually see. Our origins lie either in Asgard, or next door to it.   To understand this story, we have to go back to the very beginning. The Earth was created around 4. 5 billion years ago, and judging by some astonishingly ancient fossils, life emerged relatively soon after. For the longest time, living things belonged to two great domains: the bacteria and the archaea, both microscopic and both comprising single cells. That was the status quo for at least 1. 7 billion years, until the two domains were joined by a third: the eukaryotes. And they were very different. Eukaryotic cells are generally much bigger than either bacteria or archaea. They also have larger genomes. They have internal compartments that act like our organs, each with its own special job. They have an internal skeleton that acts as a transport network for molecules. There’s this huge gulf of complexity that separates them from the other two domains. It’s a gulf that has only ever been crossed once in life’s history. Bacteria and archaea are capable of amazing feats of evolution, but in over 3. 7 billion years of existence, none of them have ever evolved into anything approaching a   cell —  except that one time. Why?   One possible answer, which I’ve written about before, says that eukaryotes were created through an incredibly unlikely merger between members of the other two domains. Somehow, a bacterium found its way inside an archaeon and, rather than being digested or destroyed, became a permanent part of its host. In doing so, it provided the archaeon with an extra source of energy, which allowed it to get bigger, accumulate more genes, and evolve down new paths that were previously inaccessible to it. That fusion cell gave rise to the eukaryotes, and the bacterium eventually turned into the mitochondria —  little   structures that still power eukaryotic cells to this day. Once the eukaryotes evolved, they repeatedly engulf microbes and fused with them —  a process called endosymbiosis. But that’s much easier to do when the host cell is already big, and can engulf smaller neighbors. If the host is an archaeon, the feat becomes much harder and far more improbable. That’s maybe why the merger between an archaeon and a bacterium —  the one that gave rise to mitochondria and may have spawned the eukaryotes —  has only happened once. What were those two ancient partners like? We know that the bacterium belonged to a group called the alphaproteobacteria (which also includes Wolbachia, a microbe that I’ve repeatedly written about here.) But until recently, no one knew anything about the archaeon host.   Ettema changed that in 2015. His team at Uppsala University collected samples of sediment from Loki’s Castle —  a field of hydrothermal vents that lie between Greenland and Norway, at depths of 2, 300 meters. By analyzing the DNA within their sample, the team identified a new archaeon that they called Lokiarchaeota (     ). Their DNA revealed that they are the closest living relatives of all eukaryotes. They’re the best approximations that we have for that ancestral archaeon that gave rise to us all. Loki isn’t alone. Last year, another group led by Brett Baker at the University of Texas in Austin discovered a related group of archaea in the mud of North Carolina’s White Oak River continuing the theme, they called it Thorarchaeota. Now, by teaming up, Ettema, Baker, and others have found even more relatives in sites around the world: Yellowstone National Park, a hot spring in New Zealand,   vents lying near a Japanese island, and many more. “This work is fantastic: going out to the sediments of the planet and digging up the weird and wonderful bugs that live there,” says James McInerney from the University of Manchester. These microbes fall into four major groups: Lokiarchaeota, Thorarchaeota, Odinarchaeota, and Heimdallarchaeota. “There’s around 50 more Asgardian gods, we’re good to go for the next few years,” says Ettema. These four lineages all belong to an overarching supergroup that the team have called Asgard. And we eukaryotes either sit within the Asgardian family tree, or just outside it. We descend directly from either members of the group (perhaps within the Heimdall branch) or from incredibly close relatives. The genomes of the Asgardian microbes hold many surprises. When Ettema looked at their DNA, he was surprised to find genes that are supposedly unique to eukaryotes. Some are for building and remodeling internal skeletons, which archaea don’t have. Others are involved in pinching off bits of the outer membrane to create little pockets that can move molecules around large cells —  and yet, archaea are small. Yet others are typically involved in shuttling molecules between the compartments inside eukaryotic cells —  compartments that typically don’t exist in archaea. When Ettema first found these genes in Loki two years ago, other scientists were skeptical. Perhaps they came from eukaryotes that had contaminated Ettema’s samples. But the presence of such genes in other members of Asgard, collected by different teams from different corners of the world, suggests that they’re real. This doesn’t mean that the Asgardians are eukaryotes themselves, or even anything close. As James McInernery and Mary O’Connell write, “The distribution of genes formerly thought to be   is patchy,” so that no single Asgardian has “a full set. ” Instead, it seems that “the building blocks for those   traits were most likely already present in our archaeal ancestors,” says Ettema. This feeds into a   and still unsettled debate about the origin of eukaryotes. Some scientists believe that the bacterium that would become the mitochondria was swallowed by a host cell that was already big, complex, and most of the way to becoming a eukaryote. Others hold that the host was still a true archaeon, and that it was the merger that allowed it to become more complex. On the face of it, the presence of   genes in Asgard supports the former idea. But Ettema disagrees. Based on their genomes, “they’re not very sophisticated cells, but they have many of the right components in place,” he says. “They were primed to become eukaryotes. ” This debate is likely to rage on for a while, because no one has actually seen the Asgardians themselves. In the 1980s, scientists developed ways of identifying microbes by searching for their DNA amid environmental samples. This is now the main way of finding new species, but it means that many microbes —  like Loki and its kin —  are only known through their DNA. No one knows what they look like. “It’s high on our priority list,” says Ettema. “It’s crucial that we have a look at the cells to see what they’re doing, but that’s extremely hard. Loki was discovered in   ocean sediments, where you don’t go every day. Thor and Heimdall are present in shallower environments, but they’re less than 0. 1 percent of the total microbial community. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack, but we’re working on it. ”"
Obama’s Ingenious Mention of Atticus Finch,"“If our democracy is to work in this increasingly diverse nation,” Barack Obama said in his farewell address last night, “each one of us must try to heed the advice of one of the great characters in American fiction, Atticus Finch. ” He then quoted Finch: “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . .. until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.” Chelsea Clinton’s Apt Wrinkle in Time   In the moment, it occurred to some viewers that Finch also provided   quotes on diversity. Like, “Have you ever considered that you can’t have a set of backward people living among people advanced in one civilization and have a social Arcadia?” Like, “Do you want Negroes by the carload in our schools and churches and theaters?” Like, “The Negroes down here are still in their childhood as a people. ” The vision of Atticus Finch that Obama referenced was the upstanding one that Americans have idolized for decades, naming their sons and bars and   companies after him. That Finch is the lawyer and father of Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, who in the 1930s South defended a black man wrongly accused of rape and generally stood as a beacon of decency and tolerance. But Finch all along has been a more complicated figure than many recognize, with one line of academic inquiry arguing him as a paternalistic figure. Seeming to confirm that reading, in 2015 Finch’s reputation took a hit with the publication of Go Set a Watchman, a newly unearthed manuscript by Lee telling of Mockingbird’s characters 20 years after that novel’s events. It wasn’t a sequel but rather a draft set apparently in a different reality, with details contradicting those of Mockingbird. And in it, an adult Scout Finch returns to Maycomb County, Alabama, to find her father, now 72, has become an outspoken racist. The novel follows her struggle to reconcile what she had seen in childhood with what had become of her dad and her hometown, where the civil rights movement had inflamed white hatred. It’s unlikely that Obama, or at least his speechwriters, didn’t know about these   complications for Atticus Finch. But it is possible they calculated that for most Americans, the enduring image of Finch is the one set by To Kill a Mockingbird in 1960, not the one from Go Set a Watchman. It’s also possible some more nuanced signaling was going on —  a call for understanding with Trump supporters, and a call for the renewal of battered American ideals. The Finch quote came during a portion of Obama’s speech devoted to how racial tension poses a threat to democracy. While many of his remarks addressed the white majority that elected Donald Trump, he also asked Americans who’ve been discriminated against to show some empathy toward many of their antagonists. “Blacks and other minorities” should be “tying our own struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face,” he said, including that of “the   white man who from the outside may seem like he’s got all the advantages, but who’s seen his world upended by economic, cultural, and technological change. ” That admonition is much the kind of rhetoric that has often frustrated Obama’s liberal critics who say that he’s been too evenhanded, too willing to engage in false equivalencies, to fully call out American racism. His speech took at least one shot at those critics: “I’ve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10, or 20, or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say. ” By invoking Finch in the same section where he asked for empathy toward resentful white men, he is doubling down: For America to overcome the prejudices of people as bitter as the Watchman version of Finch, those people need to be understood. Whether you agree with that thought or not, it’s a clever use of literary reference to push back at Obama’s critics to the left who’ve read his focus on incrementalism and individual change as capitulation. Many of those critics might have written off Finch even   Obama might have countered them by saying, not for the first time in his public life, that each person’s empathy matters even in the face of an unjust system. More than anything, though, the invocation of a flawed American icon’s enduring,   bit of wisdom underlines what Obama’s message was throughout the speech. Go Set a Watchman told of a time of supposed progress —  desegregation —  that was met with furious, disheartening backlash. Obama’s words last night would have offered Scout comfort in the 1950s just as they offered comfort for his supporters in January 2017: “For every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back.  But the long sweep of America has been defined by forward motion, a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all, and not just some. ” Obama was not necessarily denying the troubling person Atticus Finch may have become, just as he was not denying the country’s troubling situation now. But he was calling on America to ensure that the best version of itself, and the best versions of its heroes, remerges."
"Donald Trump Meets, and Assails, the Press","Updated on January 11 at 5:05 p. m. In his first press conference since July 2016,   Donald Trump took only a few questions but made news on several fronts, saying he accepted the conclusion that Russia conducted hacks on top Democrats, bashing the press, and refusing once again to release his tax returns. Trump also refused to answer questions about whether any of his aides had been in contact with Russian officials, though he later said they had not as he departed the press conference. During the press conference, Trump announced a plan he said would answer concerns about conflicts of interest between the government and his business interests, yielding the stage to an attorney to explain the arrangement. The   was in combative mode, scolding reporters and the intelligence community and dodging several questions. He was asked early on about a pair of stories that emerged Tuesday night —  one, from CNN, saying that he had been briefed on a memo that said Russia agents claimed to have compromising information on him, and a second, from BuzzFeed, that posted a dubious dossier of allegations. He blasted the publication of that dossier, and thanked news organizations that had not run it. “I read what was released, and I think it was a disgrace,” Trump said. He would not comment on whether he had been briefed on the material, saying briefings were classified, but he said the allegations contained in the memo and dossier were untrue. But Trump said for the first time that he believed the Kremlin had conducted the hacks against the Democratic National Committee and others, but he downplayed that particular action as just one of many. “As far as hacking I think it was Russia, but I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people,” he said. (He later added, in response to a separate question, that it “could’ve been others also. ”) Trump offered an ambiguous read on the publication of private material, on the one hand blasting the leak of the dossier to the press —  an action that he pinned, without proof and probably incorrectly, on the intelligence community —  while at the same time suggesting that the hacking of the DNC was bad but somewhat mitigated because of the information it revealed. The   refused to answer questions about whether any of his aides had been in contact with Russian officials, as some reports have stated. In an extremely tense exchange, he dismissed dogged questioning from CNN’s Jim Acosta, saying, “You are fake news. ” As he left the press conference, however, he answered another reporter who reprised the question, saying, “No. ” Trump insisted, despite copious reporting to the contrary as well as his own son’s statements, that he did not and never had business dealings in Russia. When a reporter asked him whether he would release his taxes to prove that, he once again demurred, claiming they are under audit. (He has not proved that claim, and the IRS says there’s nothing to prevent him from releasing taxes that are under audit.) Yet he also seemed to suggest that having won the election, he no longer had any incentive to release the returns. “The only ones that care about my tax returns are the reporters,” he said. “I mean, I won! I became president!” (A recent Pew poll found that 60 percent of Americans would like Trump to make the documents public.) The details of Trump’s plan to solve his conflicts of interest remain to be explored and parsed, though he made several peculiar comments during the press conference. He asserted, dubiously, that he has very little debt. He claimed to have been offered a $2 billion deal in Dubai over the weekend, but he said he’d turned it down —  even though, he said, he had no obligation to do so. “I could actually run my business and run the government at the same time,” Trump said. He added, “I have a   situation because I’m president. ” That’s an outrageous statement. While not all    laws apply to the president, the lack of legal constraints does not mean conflicts of interest cannot exist. Moreover, Trump is still subject to the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, among other rules. Before taking questions, Trump boasted about companies opening new factories in the U. S. or canceling planned offshoring. Although he claimed credit, most of those decisions were made prior to his election. “I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created, and I mean that,” he said. And Trump promised to continue to throw his weight around. He thanked states that had voted for him on Election Day and seemed to suggest that those states would be rewarded. He attacked pharmaceutical companies for charging high prices, and said the federal government should bargain with them. Current federal law bars such negotiation for Medicare. While Democrats have long lobbied for greater bargaining power, pushing this argument could put the   into conflict with Republicans in Congress, who have opposed bargaining. Yet as much as the event was a chance for the press to address Trump, it was also a forum for Trump to address —  and dress down —  the press. The first speaker was incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who called the publication of the dossier “frankly shameful and disgraceful. ” Next up was Mike Pence, who scolded reporters that “with freedom comes responsibility. ” When Trump himself arrived at the lectern, he, too, attacked reporters. “It’s very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on a nearly daily basis,” Trump said. “We stopped having them because we were getting a lot inaccurate news. ” He also thanked news organizations that had not published the dossier. “I have great respect for the news, and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that,” Trump insisted."
Trump: ’I Think’ Hacking Was Russian,"Updated at 12:25 p. m. After months of equivocating on the origin of cyberattacks that targeted Democrats before the election,   Donald Trump said Wednesday that he thinks Russia was behind the intrusions. “As for hacking, I think it was Russian,” Trump said at a press conference in New York. “But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. ” Later, he emphasized his skepticism. “It could’ve been others also,” he said. At a meeting on Friday, the   was briefed on classified intelligence by the heads of the NSA, FBI, and CIA, as well as the Director of National Intelligence. They presented a report that concluded, with high confidence, that the Russian government directed the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats like Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, John Podesta. The investigation also found that that the Russian campaign, ordered by President Vladimir Putin, was engineered to help get Trump elected. A brief, unclassified summary of the agencies’ findings was made public last week. Trump said he expects hacking will subside once he takes office. “Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I’m leading it than when other people are leading it. You will see that,” he said. “[Putin] shouldn’t have done it. I don’t believe he’ll do it anymore. ” After touching on Russia’s cyberattacks, the   brought up the data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management in 2014 and 2015, which were linked to the Chinese government. He says the   hacking has been blown out of proportion, and that other governments are also involved in  . (One key difference: Information stolen in the OPM data breach has not been made public, while Russian agents leaked sensitive communications between Democrats to WikiLeaks and other mouthpieces for publication.) Trump blamed the Democratic National Committee for its lax cybersecurity, and praised its Republican counterpart for its network protection. He claimed that hackers were “unable to break through” the Republican National Committee’s defenses —  but the FBI says Russian hackers were in fact able to penetrate some “old” computer systems that were “no longer in use. ” Asked if the Russia’s hacking campaign was justified, Trump deflected the question. He said that he has “no dealings” with Russia which would leave him vulnerable to being influenced, but declined again to release his tax records to back up his claim."
Seth Meyers Questions Kellyanne Conway (and the Politics of Late-Night),"Here was one of the first questions that Seth Meyers,   comedian, posed to Kellyanne Conway, pollster and counselor to the president, when she appeared on his show on Tuesday evening: CNN has a report that the intelligence community briefed both the president and the   with allegations that the Russian government has compromising information on   Trump —  both business information and personal information. I know this just happened. Can you confirm or comment on the fact that the intelligence community has presented this? The question may have come from a comedian. Its recipient may have been clad in sequins and seated in a plush easy chair. The duo’s exchange might have taken place amid all the glinty aesthetics of   comedy. Still: Squint, and it looked an awful lot like journalism. It wasn’t just Meyers’s request that Conway “confirm or comment” on the CNN report. It was also his deflections of Conway’s own attempts to deflect his queries. It was his question, in response to Conway’s assertion that “nobody has proven” that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, “But shouldn’t we care if the Russians tried to interfere, whether it affected the outcome of the election or not?” And it was his response, when Conway told him that Trump “has said that he is not aware of that” —  the “that” in this case meaning, ostensibly, the briefings that were the subject of the CNN report —  that the  ’s lack of awareness “concerns me. ” It was his further response, when Conway met Meyers’s note about Trump’s apparent lack of curiosity in determining the extent of the Russian involvement in the election with “he was curious enough to figure out America”: “That’s a pivot right there, Kellyanne. ” (He added: “And, by the way, no one does it better. ”) That the pair’s exchange would be contentious was, on the one hand, entirely unsurprising. Meyers, first of all, has made no secret of his (progressive) partisanship. His audience was clearly on his side in the engagement. And the questions he asked Conway took on the specificity they did in part because of the interview’s timing: The news of Trump’s being briefed about the compromising information, first reported by CNN, broke right before Late Night taped. But Meyers also took the stance he did because of the changes that have come to   comedy in recent years —  and, especially, within the most recent one.   may once have offered an easy way for politicians to connect with people and humanize themselves in the eyes of public, via sax performances, charming discussions of pets, and the like occasionally, it still does that. As the lines between “politics” and “everything else” have faded, though, even the   couch has doubled, ever more, as a hot seat. Trevor Noah grilled the conservative pundit Tomi Lahren when she appeared on his show late last year. Samantha Bee interviewed Obama. The bookers for The Late Show With Stephen Colbert saw to it that the very first episode of their new series would feature, as Colbert’s guest,   frontrunner Jeb Bush. That Meyers would end up asking a guest to “confirm or comment” on “allegations” provided by the intelligence community was in that sense not a moment of deviation from the norms of   comedy it was a perfect example of them. And Meyers himself has also gone out of his way to emphasize the civic responsibilities of   comedy. As he put it during his show’s monologue the day after the 2016 presidential election, “Donald Trump made a lot of promises as to what he was going to do over the next four years, and now we get to see if he will, if he can, fulfill them. So I’d just like to make one promise to him: We here at Late Night will be watching you. ” Conway is not Trump she is, however, a close adviser to him. And she is, furthermore, (in) famously skilled at the Sun       arts of rhetorical deflection and political spin. Softballs, because of all that —  the traditional stuff of the prior age of   banter —  simply wouldn’t have been appropriate for Meyers’s interview. And while she has been an omnipresence on cable TV —  a fact that was mocked recently, and delightfully, by Meyers’s former employer —  she has not been a mainstay of the   circuit. How Comedians Became Public Intellectuals, All of which added up to this: On Tuesday, Meyers’s viewers —  and the many, many people who watched his interview of Conway after the fact, via Twitter and YouTube and media summaries like this one —  watched an interview that might as well have taken place on cable news. An interview that attempted to hold Conway —  and, by extension, her boss —  to account. They were watching, at the same time, one more example of journalism’s expansion into the world of entertainment. And of entertainment’s expansion into journalism. They are movements that have been, in many ways, inevitable. Journalism, in the U. S. is messy by design. There are no professional guilds, as in law and medicine, that regulate who may, and may not, engage in its practice. There are only a lot of voices —  ever more voices —  joined by a very loose set of goals and aspirations: that facts matter. That ideas do, too. And that —  a less widely shared aspiration, but an animating one nonetheless —  democracy demands groups of people who are willing to speak truth to power, whoever, and however, they may be. Increasingly, those people are entertainers. Comedians are serving, more and more, as political activists.   comedy is becoming, more and more, a place of earnest —  and informed —  political debate. The lines between journalism and other ways of understanding the world —  between media as information and media as entertainment —  are vanishing. Whether  that will prove to be a beneficial development for American democracy, or the opposite, remains to be seen. But it is, in general, the new state of affairs. So much so that a presidential adviser could settle down into an easy chair and be asked not to share a lighthearted anecdote, but to respond to a CNN report. So much so, as well, that her host, when she tried to deflect his questions, would make a point of calling out her attempts at spin. “I’m very excited about this,” Meyers told Conway, during the Late Night interview that helped to erase those lines. He added: “And, obviously, I think a lot of the questions I’m asking you will be asked to the   tomorrow. ” The event taking place “tomorrow”? A press conference.  "
Obama Frames His Economic Legacy,"In Barack Obama’s final speech as president, he touted nearly a decade of economic improvement. “If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history  …     you might have said our sights were set a little too high,” he said to great applause. But despite his cheery retrospective, the outgoing president also had words of warning, particularly about the important link between the country’s political stability and its economic health. A polarized country, he suggested, is the fastest route to economic ruin. Likewise, a dysfunctional economy will produce political polarization. They are inseparable. Looking at where the economy stood when Obama took office in January of 2009, it’s impossible to deny the progress that has been made. “Today, the economy is growing again wages, incomes, home values, and retirement accounts are rising again poverty is falling again. The wealthy are paying a fairer share of taxes even as the stock market shatters records. The unemployment rate is near a   low,” Obama said. While many would dispute whether the tax code is indeed ”fairer,” the fact that the 44th president entered office during one of the worst recessions in recent memory and leaves an economy significantly stronger than he found it is a point of fact. As my colleague Bourree Lam wrote, the final jobs report of the Obama presidency showed that he presided over 75 months of consecutive job growth, a feat surpassing many of his predecessors —  though one that was partly enabled because the job loss sustained during the early years of his administration was so staggering. At the end of his term, the unemployment rate will hover below 5 percent —  half of where it was at the nadir of the recession. And while there’s been much debate about the quality of the jobs added, and criticism of the decreasing   participation rate, in the last year of Obama’s presidency the economy showed a   sign of strength: wage growth. But despite these gains, the economy still shows signs of weakness. And in his farewell speech Obama addressed the fact that many   and   Americans continue to struggle with underemployment, insufficient wages, and higher costs of living, even as a small portion of wealthy Americans grow richer. This uneven progress isn’t just frustrating, it’s a threat to the basic tenets of fairness and possibility that fuel faith in the country, he suggested. “Our democracy won’t work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunity,” Obama said, touching on inequality and social mobility, two issues that have been referenced again and again during his administration. In the wake of Donald Trump’s election, one couldn’t help but remember that this growing inequality was a focus of both parties during the election. The GOP blamed it on Obama and democratic policies, a position that seems to have brought to the polls a very specific base of   white voters, frustrated by job loss and limited economic mobility. Obama spoke to this dynamic, if somewhat indirectly, “While the top one percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income, too many families, in inner cities and rural counties, have been left behind —  the   factory worker the waitress and health care worker who struggle to pay the bills —  convinced that the game is fixed against them, that their government only serves the interests of the powerful —  a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politics,” he said. In these statements, Obama attempted to bridge the gap between Americans who share the burden of economic suffering but remain divided within the electorate by region, race, occupation, and political affiliation. But more than a salve between the groups, Obama’s statements also contained a warning for those wooed by Trump’s promises to bring back jobs in middle America and the Rust Belt —  those who feel that they would still be thriving economically if not for Democratic policies. “The next wave of economic dislocation won’t come from overseas. It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good,   jobs obsolete,” he said. His prescription for this future threat stands in direct opposition to Trump’s platform of locking out foreign workers, closing borders, and lowering both individual and corporate tax rates: “We must forge a new social compact —  to guarantee all our kids the education they need to give workers the power to unionize for better wages to update the social safety net to reflect the way we live now and make more reforms to the tax code so corporations and individuals who reap the most from the new economy don’t avoid their obligations to the country that’s made their success possible. ” Obama, predictably, ended on an optimistic note, asking Americans to be vigilant but not afraid, and to find more common ground than reason for division. The economy, he reminded, doesn’t have to be a   game."
The Trump Administration’s Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet,"With confirmation hearings beginning, attention is shifting slightly away from Trump and toward those who may make up his administration. Like the   under whom they may soon be serving, many of Trump’s nominees have been pulled from the upper echelons of the business community or are otherwise political outsiders. Also like Trump, many of them have come under significant scrutiny for how their pasts may lead to conflicts of interest with the roles they are nominated to serve. These are especially noteworthy because, unlike during the transitions to previous administrations, it appears that this year’s confirmation hearings will begin before the Office of Government Ethics has had adequate time to perform background checks. This highly unusual turn of events goes against the explicit objection of the Director of the OGE, who wrote in a letter to the Senate’s Democratic leadership that he is “not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate has held a confirmation hearing before the nominee has completed the ethics review” and warned, “For as long as I am Director, OGE’s staff and agency ethics officials will not succumb to pressure to cut corners and ignore conflicts of interest. ” (Also of note is a letter from current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who in 2008 sent   Majority Leader Harry Reid a letter detailing his expectations for thorough ethical clearance but is now questioning the motives of those calling for the same for Trump’s nominees.) Moreover, in contrast with the rules for the president, there are both explicit rules regarding conflicts of interest for appointed officials and a long history of appointed officials abusing their offices for personal financial gain. With regard to the former, the law “prohibits an executive branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a particular Government matter that will affect his own financial interests” or those of his family members, a general partner, or any organization with whom he or she “serves as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, or employee” or may one day be employed. Violations could result in jail time of up to five years, a fine of up to $50, 000, or both investigations into alleged misconduct fall under the purview of the Justice Department. For the latter, perhaps the most infamous example of   officeholders acting in their personal financial interests is the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s, in which Warren G. Harding’s Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall was convicted of accepting bribes in administering the leases for oil reserves in Wyoming and California. The administration of Ulysses S. Grant, meanwhile, was plagued by scandals in seven federal departments, ranging from gold speculation in the State Department to bribery for postal contracts, to the Whiskey Ring scandal, which led to the resignation of Grant’s Supervisor of Internal Revenue and his personal secretary. In recent decades, more than 100 of Ronald Reagan’s appointees, including Attorney General Edwin Meese and Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver, were investigated for financial impropriety, leading to numerous firings and resignations. During the Obama administration, opponents accused Steven Spinner, who served in multiple   roles in the Department of Energy, of inappropriately pushing for a $535 million loan guarantee for the solar company Solyndra while his wife worked at a law firm representing the company. Even more recently, allegations of conflicts of interest were arguably central to the 2016 presidential campaign, in which Trump repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton of inappropriately commingling her office as Secretary of State with her family’s foundation. Adding to all of these concerns is the fact that Trump’s family members appear likely to have a larger role in his administration than a president’s family has had in any administration since John F. Kennedy’s appointment of his brother as Attorney General led to the creation of     laws. Ivanka Trump, for example, is poised to take on many of the duties typically expected of a First Lady, and has sat in on at least one of her father’s meeting with a    her adult siblings, Donald Jr. and Eric, are members of their father’s transition team and often seen as among his closest confidants, although it remains unclear what, if any, official roles they will take on in his administration. And Trump’s    Jared Kushner, whom many expect will be one of the  ’s top advisers once he takes office, has   and publishing interests of his own that could intersect with his official duties. As my colleague Olga Khazan noted, the question with conflicts of interest is not if, but when and how much they will affect behavior. Research into doctors who receive gifts from drug companies —  often as apparently meaningless as a pen or clipboard —  shows that “even small kickbacks can change   individuals’ behavior” by subtly changing how a doctor perceives the company behind the gift. As such, The Atlantic will be expanding our coverage of Trump’s conflicts of interests to include those expected to serve in his administration. Below is the current list of Trump’s prospective administration members, official and otherwise, whose actions or financial entanglements have prompted concerns over conflicts of interest. Because the law requires most aspirants for   positions to resolve such questions before entering office, some have already taken the steps necessary to mitigate conflicts of interest these steps will be noted as applicable. The most recent updates appear at the top: Trump’s Family Members, Though Trump has not —  in fact, cannot —  appointed any members of his direct family to a post in his administration, it nevertheless appears that they will likely have significant input in his administration. According to numerous sources, Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka, is likely to take on a policy portfolio roughly on par with that of a typical first lady just what it will comprise is not yet known, although based on meetings she has taken since the election with Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Gore, climate change has arisen as a possibility. Meanwhile, according to NBC, her husband, Jared Kushner, will be serving as a senior adviser to the president. And though Trump’s adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, apparently will not be serving in any official capacity within their father’s administration, they are nonetheless widely seen as among his closest confidants and are members of his transition team. Already, Trump’s three aforementioned children’s proximity to the   has created significant conflicts of interest. (Trump’s other adult child, Tiffany, does not appear likely to be part of the administration.) Much of this revolves around their father’s professed commitment to resolving issues with his namesake corporation by putting his assets into a trust that will be managed by Donald Jr. and Eric. As I have previously written, though Trump and his supporters have referred to the plan he has described as a blind trust (or, more recently, a “  trust,” which is a thing that doesn’t exist) the children’s   role as advisers to their father means they don’t have nearly enough separation to maintain a true blind trust. (And since so much of Trump’s business derives from real estate and his personal brand, even a real blind trust would not be sufficient to allay concerns about conflicts of interest, as he will retain his knowledge of what those assets are). Additionally, since Trump’s election, Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric have all been photographed in meetings that compromise even the illusion of distance from their father’s political dealings. All three appeared in photos of a summit between their father and the leaders of numerous technology companies, as well as a meeting with the   and his Indian business partners. Ivanka and her husband sat in on a meeting between their father and the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, even though Ivanka was at the time negotiating a branding deal with a company owned in part by the Japanese government. Donald Jr. and Eric, who the   has decided will run the business in his stead, have both attended meetings on their father’s behalf. Along with the    problems, all three have drawn criticism for allegedly selling access to the administration through their companies or charitable foundations. After Ivanka appeared on 60 Minutes, her company sent out an advertisement for the $10, 000 bracelet that she wore on air. On December 6, the Eric Trump Foundation initiated an online auction for a chance to have a meeting over coffee with Ivanka as criticism mounted, the foundation removed the web page, though not before the bidding reached more than $70, 000. And both Eric and Donald Jr. were involved in a planned, but ultimately cancelled, charity fundraiser scheduled for the day after their father takes office whose attendees could pay up to $1 million for a private reception with the   as well as a hunting trip with one of his two sons. In the aftermath, Trump announced that Eric would be closing down his foundation to prevent further speculation. Meanwhile, Jared Kushner’s business entanglements also create conflicts with his expected role in the Trump administration. First and foremost, some ethics experts believe that his involvement will trip federal   laws that have been in place since after John F. Kennedy named his brother Robert to the post of attorney general, although Trump’s and Kushner’s lawyers have concluded otherwise. On January 7, just two days before Trump’s transition team confirmed that Kushner would officially be taking a position, The New York Times reported that he has been pursuing a deal with the Chinese financial giant Anbang Insurance to redevelop 666 Fifth Avenue, a centerpiece of his   holdings. Kushner’s brother, Josh Kushner, is a   of the healthcare startup Oscar, which could stand to make millions off of the potential restructuring of the insurance market should Trump pursue repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. According to The New York Times, Kushner’s lawyer has said that he is taking several steps to mitigate conflicts of interest. These include getting rid of his common stocks and his stake in the New York Observer, selling many of his assets to his brother, creating a family trust to be controlled by his mother, and resigning from his role as chief executive of Kushner Companies. Though Kushner is so far taking more active steps than his    has, problems remain. As is the case with Trump’s proposed trust, having a family member administer a trust does not create nearly enough separation to make it truly blind. Moreover, like the  ’s business, many of Kushner’s assets are   simply handing over their operations doesn’t override Kushner’s existing knowledge of what will affect their value, even if he says he will recuse himself from decisions that may affect them. In other words, as with his    conflicts of interest will remain unless Kushner takes more complete steps to distance himself from sources of income that could influence his   in the White House.  Back to table of contents, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, After weeks of speculation and apparent interest in several more conventional possibilities, Trump eventually settled on Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, as his nominee for Secretary of State. Though Tillerson, who has a net worth in the hundreds of millions, is actually among the less wealthy of Trump’s nominees, his position as head of the world’s largest publicly traded international    company has led to questions as to whether he will be able to fully divorce his business interests from his official duties. As is the case with the   he is expected to serve, much of the consternation over Tillerson relates to his apparently unusually copacetic relationship with Vladimir Putin. In fact, according to Steven Coll’s book on the company, Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power, the relationship, which culminated in Tillerson receiving an award called “the Russian Order of Friendship” from Putin, was a key reason Tillerson was chosen as the company’s CEO in 2006. Alexey Pushkov, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of Russian parliament, weighed in on Tillerson’s nomination on Twitter shortly after it was announced, calling the nomination “a sensation. ” Along with his ties to Putin, Tillerson’s nomination has raised concerns because of Exxon’s complicated relationship with the U. S. government. According to the Financial Times, while Tillerson was in charge of the company, Exxon signed multiple deals with the Russian   oil company Rosneft —  whose chief, Igor Sechin, is considered a member of Putin’s inner circle —  to develop resources in the Black Sea, Siberia, and the Arctic Circle. These developments ceased, however, when the United States sanctioned the Russian oil industry in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014. As could be expected for a person in his position, Tillerson was an active opponent of the U. S.’s sanctions throughout the process after all, the sanctions have prevented Exxon from moving forward with deals reported to be worth billions of dollars. That Tillerson has publicly questioned the utility of sanctions —  and has made at least five visits to the White House since Obama authorized the sanctions —  is in a sense inextricable from his role with Exxon. As Secretary of State, he will have significant sway over those sanctions, which means that he could plausibly pursue a policy that would make his former company billions. So far, Tillerson has taken a number of steps to comply with    rules. According to CNN, Tillerson will be selling off his more than 600, 000 shares in Exxon —  currently valued at more than $54 million —  before taking office. In addition, rather than paying Tillerson his expected retirement package (2 million Exxon shares, valued at more than $181 million, over the next decade) the company will put the value of the retirement package into a blind trust that will not be allowed to invest in the oil company. And should Tillerson return to work in the    industry in the next 10 years, he would forfeit the entire sum. He is also expected to recuse himself from any issue that may affect his former company for his first two years in office. Tillerson’s divestment offers something of a model for future appointees as well as potentially for Trump himself. Though Tillerson, like Trump, has yet to respond to pressure to release his tax returns, he has created an arrangement by which his previous entanglements are sufficiently remote that he can reasonably say they no longer pose a conflict of interest.  Back to table of contents, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Wilbur Ross, Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Commerce, is one of several wealthy businesspeople in Trump’s proposed cabinet. Ross, who Trump called “a champion of American manufacturing” and “one of the greatest negotiators I have met,” is a billionaire investor who made much of his fortune by buying and reselling distressed companies, including those in the steel, coal, and textile industries. Along the way, Ross had a record of outsourcing jobs and slashing benefits for workers at the companies that he took over, as well as for a 2006 explosion at a mine operated by a company he owned. Ross’s financial holdings also create significant conflicts of interest that he will have to navigate before he assumes office. For example, Ross has a stake in, and sits on the board of, ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producer, a company that frequently has a major stake in the Commerce Department’s regulation of the steel industry, including its monitoring of exports, imports, and tariffs. In fact, according to ProPublica, during the first 100 days of Trump’s administration, the Commerce Department is likely to be ruling on investigations into unfair pricing of steel imports from Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy, all of which could significantly affect ArcelorMittal’s profits and stock prices. Ross is also a vice chairman of the Bank of Cyprus, where he served alongside Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch who Putin recently placed in charge of a major initiative to bring   jobs to Russia and who was once accused of hiring gunmen to take control of a Siberian oil field. Though Ross has stated that he intends to step down from his position, his namesake   firm, WL Ross  Co. will retain its stake in the institution. Beyond the specific entanglements involving ArcelorMittal, Ross’s job as Secretary of Commerce would give him opportunities to advance his general interests in the steel industry: Unless he not only steps down from his position at ArcelorMittal but also sells his stake in the company, Ross will be profiting off of any decision by his own department that makes the company more money. As was noted during the campaign after it was reported that Trump used Chinese steel in some of his development projects, the Department of Commerce recently began a probe into the   Chinese steel industry’s avoidance of American tariffs and use of a “dumping” strategy, in which the Chinese companies undermine the American industry by flooding the market with their product at an artificially low price. As Trump’s commerce secretary, Ross would be in charge of continuing the probe and developing a strategy moving forward, which could be done in a way that makes his own holdings more valuable. So far, representatives of Trump and Ross have dismissed these concerns by comparing Ross’s situation to that of Penny Pritzker, the billionaire businesswoman who has served in the role under President Obama since 2013. In order to comply with the Office of Government Ethics’    rules, Pritzker sold off her stake in more than 200 companies and resigned from her position with Hyatt Ross could conceivably do the same and put his resulting assets in a blind trust. Until he does so, his billions in holdings and industry involvement could influence, or at the very least be seen as influencing, his   in office.  Back to table of contents, Secretary of Labor Andy Puzder, Andy Puzder, Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Labor, is one of Trump’s many nominees with a history of antagonism toward the very body he will soon be leading. As the CEO of CKE Restaurants, which owns the   chains Carl’s Jr. and Hardees, Puzder developed a long track record of opposition to   and overtime rules and   policies he also characterized the department’s policies under President Obama and current leader Tom Perez as “deterrence by ‘gotcha’ enforcement. ” Along with his antipathy toward the department, Puzder would bring to the position significant financial entanglements that could threaten his ability to discharge his duties in office. Among the Department of Labor’s duties is investigating claims of     violations and occupational safety hazards.   chains are frequent targets of such claims during Puzder’s tenure at CKE, the Labor Department investigated allegations of wage theft and other problems at several Hardee’s franchises, finding violations in nearly 60% of cases. Complicating matters is the fact that such actions typically target the individual franchisees rather than parent companies like CKE. According to Bloomberg, of the 108 investigations into   stores since 2004, only six were at   restaurants, none of which yielded a fineable violation. When Puzder first emerged as a possible candidate for the position, a source close to him suggested that, since 94 percent of Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. restaurants are franchises not directly operated by CKE, Puzder may not have to recuse himself from his company in order to carry out his duties as Secretary of Labor. However, as is true for the   himself, simply being uninvolved in the    operation of a profitable enterprise does not resolve conflicts of interest. The problem is not Puzder’s level of control over CKE and its individual franchises but the fact that he makes money off of a company that frequently comes into conflict with the very department that he will soon be heading, which could create perverse incentives to pursue policies against the interests of the company’s employees or the general public. As such, it remains an open question how Puzder will distance himself from CKE to avoid the possibility that his role with the company will interfere with his potential role in the Trump administration.

The Longstanding Crisis Facing Tribal Schools,"Havasu Canyon is home to turquoise waterfalls, billowing cottonwood trees, and red sandstone cliffs that attract thousands of tourists each year. It’s also home to the Havasupai people, a federally recognized Native American tribe allegedly subject to education conditions so dreadful it’s as if many of the reservation’s children don’t attend school at all. That’s according to a lawsuit filed in Arizona’s U. S. District Court on Thursday, which accuses the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) —  the federal agency responsible for funding and overseeing tribal schools —  of repeatedly failing to improve the learning environment at Havasupai Elementary School. Despite federal obligations to offer a diverse curriculum that incorporates the Havasupai culture and language, the suit contends, the school doesn’t even teach subjects beyond reading and math. Extracurricular activities are nonexistent, as are   services —  even though roughly half of the school’s 70 students have special needs. Students are repeatedly suspended or referred to law enforcement, with one of the plaintiffs attending class for just 20 percent of the school year when he was 8 years old. The school is so understaffed, according to the suit, that the school janitor occasionally fills in as a teacher. Sometimes it allegedly shuts down entirely. The Subtle Evolution of Native American Education, “The conditions at the Havasupai School deny to these students fundamental access to education that children across the country simply take for granted,” said Kathryn Eidmann, a staff attorney at the pro bono law firm Public Counsel and one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs, during a phone call with reporters. “This institutional disregard communicates an unmistakable message: that the government believes these children are disposable, that their education is a responsibility that the government would rather wash its hands of. ” Students at Havasupai Elementary performed at the first percentile in reading and the third percentile in math, according to   federal data cited in the complaint, meaning it placed last among the BIE’s 183 schools. It’s unclear whether the allegations will be substantiated. Both Jeff Williamson, the principal of Havasupai Elementary and a defendant in the case, and a spokeswoman for the BIE, which falls under the U. S. Department of the Interior, declined to comment. Still, the lawsuit is likely to bring greater attention to problems that have dogged BIE schools across the country for decades —  challenges the Obama administration has sought, but struggled, to address. Arne Duncan, the former U. S. education secretary, once described the BIE as “the epitome of broken” and “utterly bankrupt. ” Even the secretary of the interior, Sally Jewell, has acknowledged the bureau’s shortcomings, calling Indian education “an embarrassment. ” In demanding that the BIE commit to providing a quality education to all its students, the case, according to Eidmann, wouldn’t only be “a potential prototype for BIE schools all across the country” —  it would also establish “a precedent that applies to students in every BIE school. ”   Federal law requires that the BIE provide education at least as good as that offered to   students, but it’s   that that’s rarely the case. Graduation rates on reservations are among the lowest of all student subgroups —  the graduation rate for Native American students broadly is just 69 percent. At BIE schools, it’s 53 percent. Eight in 10 Native students are not proficient in reading, according to 2007 federal data cited in the complaint, and children at BIE schools perform significantly worse than their Native peers at regular public schools. “These issues that the children and the community of the Havasupai face are endemic to the BIE,” Alexis DeLaCruz, a staff attorney at the Native American Disability Law Center and one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, said during the call. While the vast majority of Native American students attend traditional public schools, the BIE serves nearly 50, 000 children. The BIE published a “Blueprint for Reform” in 2014, but change has been slow. The alleged conditions described in the new complaint have long been the norm for the Havasupai community —  and not because no one has pushed the BIE to change things, critics of the bureau say. Don Watahomigie, the chairman of the Havasupai Tribal Council, said on the call that the council has repeatedly approached the BIE to little avail. Laila R. (the suit does not include full last names) whose two sons attended Havasupai Elementary, said during the call that she’s tried for years to improve conditions at the school, writing letters to bureau officials in Washington, D. C. and even suing the agency. “Nothing works,” she said. Her sons fell so far behind, she continued, that she decided to move them out of the reservation.   Instruction aside, the lawsuit, in describing excessive and harsh discipline practices, hints at why so many Native Americans end up in the   system. Frank C. the grandfather of one of the plaintiffs, said on the call that his    grandson, who has special needs, was suspended and prosecuted in federal court simply for pulling wires out of a computer monitor. Children who are disciplined in school are far more likely to end up in prison as adults it goes without saying that being disciplined as a child via formal law enforcement has similarly deleterious, if not worse, effects. The alleged practices at Havasupai Elementary are, the suit contends, characteristic of those at tribal schools across the country. Indeed, a March 2014 U. S. Department of Education report found that Native Americans across the country are disciplined at disproportionate rates. Unsurprisingly, they’re also incarcerated at a rate 38 percent higher than the national average. The Havasupai Reservation lies at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It’s so remote that one can only access it by hiking, or riding a horse, or helicoptering in the village doesn’t have any cars. But its remoteness, Watahomigie said, shouldn’t be “used as a tool by BIE to ignore our educational demands or to turn a blind eye to our needs or to [justify] providing substandard educational services to our people. ”"
