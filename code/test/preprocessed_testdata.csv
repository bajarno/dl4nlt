<s> Patriots Day UNK UNK When It UNK UNK the UNK </s>,"<s> Patriots Day , UNK Berg’s new UNK that UNK the 2013 Boston UNK bombing and the UNK manhunt that UNK it , is a UNK UNK , UNK ambiguous movie from a typically UNK UNK . Patriots Day takes an UNK UNK view of the chaos , UNK and UNK UNK that UNK the bombing — the question is whether that was Berg’s intended message . For its UNK UNK time , the movie UNK the men on the UNK who UNK bring the bombers to UNK , but it’s the UNK of something more complicated than UNK that really UNK . The UNK that best UNK this UNK comes late in Patriots Day . As the UNK for one of the bombers , UNK Tsarnaev , UNK , his UNK wife Katherine ( UNK UNK ) is brought in for UNK on her UNK to the case . As she UNK for a lawyer , UNK that she “has UNK , ” her UNK UNK ( UNK UNK ) UNK , UNK , you UNK UNK UNK . ” It’s a UNK line intended to provoke a big UNK from the audience , despite its UNK legal UNK . But the film UNK it as just that — a UNK line . The questioning goes UNK , and the UNK UNK with a UNK as the movie UNK in its Katherine was never UNK with any UNK . Patriots Day is UNK with this kind of UNK , but the UNK most UNK UNK serve to UNK it . Deepwater Horizon UNK UNK UNK to the UNK , UNK against those more UNK UNK is the man at the center of the movie , Boston UNK UNK UNK Saunders , a UNK character UNK to serve as the UNK eyes and UNK at every major UNK point of the UNK . UNK played by UNK Wahlberg , the UNK of Berg’s new UNK of UNK who has played the UNK UNK at the center of UNK UNK ( 2013 ) Deepwater Horizon ( 2016 ) and now Patriots Day . UNK those other UNK , UNK character in Patriots Day didn’t really exist , and he often comes across as a UNK of UNK UNK . UNK UNK a UNK UNK and was recently UNK UNK to UNK , but UNK is on UNK with every cop , UNK or otherwise , in the UNK . When the film is UNK on Saunders , as it UNK is , it feels like a UNK UNK of a UNK event that occurred less than four years ago . Berg UNK does well to avoid UNK the 2013 bombing , which UNK 3 and UNK UNK others , and the UNK manhunt that claimed the life of a police officer . At no point does Patriots Day feel like a UNK action movie or a UNK UNK of UNK . The UNK of that day is not UNK on , outside of an UNK to make its UNK feel like real people by UNK UNK of their UNK UNK . Wahlberg , for his part , can’t help but make Saunders feel like a UNK of a UNK he’s a movie cop in a film that’s otherwise UNK UNK . Saunders , it seems , is UNK to stand in for the generally UNK , UNK Boston UNK that UNK in the days after the UNK , and Berg UNK that point home far too many UNK . There are bits that work — in the UNK aftermath of the bombs , Wahlberg UNK communicates how angry and UNK Saunders is , rather than UNK into UNK mode . He does a UNK job selling the UNK , but once his UNK UNK returns , Patriots Day UNK back to UNK UNK . That’s too bad , since the film is most UNK when it UNK UNK the UNK of the days after the bombing , and the of UNK UNK and UNK UNK . The FBI , led by UNK UNK UNK ( UNK UNK ) takes over the case , UNK the blocks attacked with bombs inside a UNK UNK and UNK through surveillance UNK for UNK . Boston UNK UNK UNK UNK ( John UNK ) UNK UNK UNK UNK ( Michael UNK ) and Boston UNK UNK UNK ( UNK UNK ) UNK there to offer their own UNK on the case . Saunders is present too , for some reason , UNK providing UNK on the UNK around UNK UNK . The UNK , UNK , UNK that played out during the manhunt are the best UNK of the film . Berg UNK shows UNK UNK over whether to release the UNK of the Tsarnaev brothers UNK from surveillance UNK before he’s fully substantiated that they’re the bombers his hand is eventually UNK by a UNK to the media . That UNK into action the series of events that led to a UNK UNK with the Tsarnaev brothers in UNK ( UNK UNK UNK UNK a police UNK there ) . Berg is UNK to UNK into the UNK chaos of that manhunt , which UNK a UNK , UNK UNK of UNK law and a UNK , UNK UNK with the brothers that saw them UNK UNK bombs at cop UNK . It’s UNK , in other words — total UNK and UNK , the kind of UNK and UNK that UNK is intended to provoke , even from those UNK to UNK it . The Boston UNK UNK to UNK the Tsarnaev brothers is UNK UNK as UNK , but it’s the UNK the UNK chains of events , and the UNK , angry UNK that UNK out as most UNK of UNK . If Berg had UNK UNK , he could have had a great film on his hands as it UNK , he’s UNK a UNK , but occasionally UNK . </s>"
<s> A UNK in the UNK for the UNK of UNK UNK </s>,"<s> In Norse UNK , humans and our world were created by a UNK of gods who UNK in the UNK of Asgard . As it UNK out , these stories have a UNK of UNK to them . UNK to a team of scientists led by UNK Ettema , Asgard is now also the UNK of a large UNK of microbes . Its members , which are named after Norse gods like UNK , Thor , Loki , and Heimdall , are found all over the world . Many of them are UNK and no one has actually seen them under a UNK . But UNK to their DNA , we know they exist . And we know that they are UNK important to us , because they may well be the group from which we evolved . If Ettema is right , UNK around two billion years ago , an Asgardian microbe ( or an incredibly close UNK ) took part in a UNK event that gave rise to the eukaryotes . That’s the group which includes humans , our UNK UNK , UNK , UNK , and every living thing made from large , complex cells — all the living things we’re most UNK with , and all the ones we can actually see . UNK UNK UNK either in Asgard , or next UNK to it . To understand this UNK , we have to go back to the very beginning . The UNK was created around UNK . 5 billion years ago , and UNK by some UNK UNK UNK , life emerged UNK soon after . For the UNK time , living things belonged to two great domains : the bacteria and the archaea , both UNK and both UNK UNK cells . That was the UNK UNK for at least 1 . 7 billion years , until the two domains were UNK by a third : the eukaryotes . And they were very different . UNK cells are generally much bigger than either bacteria or archaea . They also have UNK genomes . They have internal compartments that UNK like our UNK , each with its own special job . They have an internal UNK that UNK as a UNK UNK for molecules . UNK this UNK gulf of UNK that UNK them from the other two domains . It’s a gulf that has only ever been UNK once in UNK history . UNK and archaea are UNK of UNK UNK of UNK , but in over 3 . 7 billion years of UNK , UNK of them have ever evolved into anything UNK a cell — UNK that one time . UNK ? One possible answer , which I’ve written about before , says that eukaryotes were created through an incredibly UNK merger between members of the other two domains . UNK , a bacterium found its way inside an archaeon and , rather than being UNK or UNK , became a UNK part of its host . In UNK so , it provided the archaeon with an UNK source of UNK , which allowed it to get bigger , UNK more genes , and UNK down new UNK that were previously UNK to it . That UNK cell gave rise to the eukaryotes , and the bacterium eventually UNK into the mitochondria — little UNK that still power UNK cells to this day . UNK the eukaryotes evolved , they repeatedly engulf microbes and UNK with them — a process called UNK . But that’s much UNK to do when the host cell is already big , and can engulf UNK UNK . If the host is an archaeon , the feat UNK much UNK and far more UNK . That’s UNK why the merger between an archaeon and a bacterium — the one that gave rise to mitochondria and may have UNK the eukaryotes — has only UNK once . UNK were those two UNK UNK like ? We know that the bacterium belonged to a group called the UNK ( which also includes UNK , a microbe that I’ve repeatedly written about here . ) But until recently , no one UNK anything about the archaeon host . Ettema UNK that in 2015 . His team at UNK University UNK samples of UNK from UNK UNK — a UNK of UNK UNK that UNK between UNK and UNK , at UNK of 2 , UNK UNK . By UNK the DNA within their UNK , the team UNK a new archaeon that they called Lokiarchaeota ( ) . UNK DNA UNK that they are the closest living relatives of all eukaryotes . UNK the best UNK that we have for that UNK archaeon that gave rise to us all . Loki isn’t UNK . UNK year , UNK group led by UNK Baker at the University of UNK in UNK discovered a UNK group of archaea in the UNK of UNK UNK White UNK UNK UNK the UNK , they called it Thorarchaeota . UNK , by UNK up , Ettema , Baker , and others have found even more relatives in UNK around the world : UNK National UNK , a hot UNK in New UNK , UNK UNK near a Japanese UNK , and many more . “This work is UNK : going out to the sediments of the UNK and UNK up the UNK and UNK UNK that UNK there , ” says James UNK from the University of UNK . These microbes fall into four major groups : Lokiarchaeota , Thorarchaeota , UNK , and UNK . UNK around 50 more Asgardian gods , we’re good to go for the next few years , ” says Ettema . These four UNK all UNK to an UNK UNK that the team have called Asgard . And we eukaryotes either UNK within the Asgardian family UNK , or just outside it . We UNK UNK from either members of the group ( UNK within the Heimdall branch ) or from incredibly close relatives . The genomes of the Asgardian microbes hold many UNK . When Ettema looked at their DNA , he was UNK to find genes that are UNK UNK to eukaryotes . Some are for building and UNK internal UNK , which archaea don’t have . UNK are involved in UNK off bits of the UNK UNK to create little UNK that can move molecules around large cells — and yet , archaea are small . Yet others are typically involved in UNK molecules between the compartments inside UNK cells — compartments that typically don’t exist in archaea . When Ettema first found these genes in Loki two years ago , other scientists were UNK . UNK they came from eukaryotes that had UNK UNK samples . But the UNK of such genes in other members of Asgard , UNK by different UNK from different UNK of the world , UNK that they’re real . This doesn’t mean that the Asgardians are eukaryotes themselves , or even anything close . As James UNK and UNK UNK UNK , “The UNK of genes UNK thought to be is UNK , ” so that no UNK Asgardian has “a full set . ” UNK , it seems that “the building blocks for those UNK were most likely already present in our UNK UNK , ” says Ettema . This UNK into a and still UNK debate about the origin of eukaryotes . Some scientists believe that the bacterium that would become the mitochondria was UNK by a host cell that was already big , complex , and most of the way to becoming a UNK . UNK hold that the host was still a true archaeon , and that it was the merger that allowed it to become more complex . On the face of it , the UNK of genes in Asgard UNK the former UNK . But Ettema UNK . UNK on their genomes , UNK not very UNK cells , but they have many of the right UNK in place , ” he says . UNK were UNK to become eukaryotes . ” This debate is likely to UNK on for a while , because no one has actually seen the Asgardians themselves . In the UNK , scientists developed ways of UNK microbes by UNK for their DNA amid UNK samples . This is now the UNK way of finding new UNK , but it means that many microbes — like Loki and its UNK — are only known through their DNA . UNK one UNK what they look like . “It’s high on our UNK UNK , ” says Ettema . “It’s UNK that we have a look at the cells to see what they’re UNK , but that’s extremely UNK . Loki was discovered in UNK sediments , where you don’t go every day . Thor and Heimdall are present in UNK UNK , but they’re less than UNK . 1 percent of the total UNK community . It’s like UNK for a UNK in a UNK , but we’re UNK on it . ” </s>"
<s> Obama’s UNK UNK of Atticus Finch </s>,"<s> “If our democracy is to work in this UNK diverse UNK , ” Barack Obama said in his UNK address last night , UNK one of us UNK UNK to UNK the UNK of one of the great UNK in American UNK , Atticus Finch . ” He UNK UNK Finch : “You never really understand a person until you UNK things from his point of view . UNK until you UNK into his UNK and UNK around in UNK UNK Clinton’s UNK UNK in UNK In the moment , it occurred to some viewers that Finch also provided UNK on UNK . Like , UNK you ever considered that you can’t have a set of UNK people living among people UNK in one UNK and have a social UNK ? ” Like , UNK you UNK Negroes by the UNK in our schools and UNK and UNK ? ” Like , “The Negroes down here are still in their childhood as a people . ” The UNK of Atticus Finch that Obama UNK was the UNK one that Americans have UNK for decades , UNK their sons and bars and companies after him . That Finch is the lawyer and father of UNK UNK To Kill a Mockingbird , who in the UNK UNK UNK a UNK man UNK accused of UNK and generally stood as a UNK of UNK and UNK . But Finch all UNK has been a more complicated figure than many UNK , with one line of UNK UNK UNK him as a UNK figure . UNK to UNK that reading , in 2015 UNK UNK took a UNK with the publication of Go Set a Watchman , a UNK UNK UNK by UNK UNK of UNK UNK 20 years after that UNK events . It UNK a UNK but rather a UNK set apparently in a different UNK , with details UNK those of Mockingbird . And in it , an adult UNK Finch returns to UNK UNK , UNK , to find her father , now UNK , has become an UNK UNK . The UNK UNK her struggle to UNK what she had seen in childhood with what had become of her UNK and her UNK , where the UNK UNK UNK had UNK white UNK . It’s UNK that Obama , or at least his UNK , didn’t know about these UNK for Atticus Finch . But it is possible they UNK that for most Americans , the enduring UNK of Finch is the one set by To Kill a Mockingbird in UNK , not the one from Go Set a Watchman . It’s also possible some more UNK UNK was going on — a call for understanding with Trump supporters , and a call for the UNK of UNK American UNK . The Finch UNK came during a portion of Obama’s speech UNK to how UNK UNK UNK a threat to democracy . While many of his UNK UNK the white UNK that UNK Donald Trump , he also asked Americans UNK been UNK against to show some empathy toward many of their UNK . UNK and other UNK should be UNK our own UNK for UNK to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face , ” he said , including that of “the white man who from the outside may UNK like he’s UNK all the UNK , but UNK seen his world UNK by economic , UNK , and UNK change . ” That UNK is much the kind of UNK that has often UNK Obama’s UNK critics who say that he’s been too UNK , too willing to UNK in UNK UNK , to fully call out American UNK . His speech took at least one UNK at those critics : UNK UNK long enough to know that UNK UNK are better than they were 10 , or 20 , or UNK years ago , no matter what some UNK say . ” By UNK Finch in the same UNK where he asked for empathy toward UNK white men , he is UNK down : For America to UNK the UNK of people as UNK as the Watchman version of Finch , those people UNK to be UNK . Whether you UNK with that thought or not , it’s a UNK use of UNK UNK to UNK back at Obama’s critics to the left UNK read his UNK on UNK and individual change as UNK . Many of those critics might have written off Finch even Obama might have UNK them by saying , not for the first time in his public life , that each UNK empathy UNK even in the face of an UNK system . UNK than anything , though , the UNK of a UNK American UNK enduring , UNK of UNK UNK what Obama’s message was UNK the speech . Go Set a Watchman told of a time of UNK progress — UNK — that was met with UNK , UNK UNK . Obama’s words last night would have offered UNK comfort in the UNK just as they offered comfort for his supporters in January UNK : “For every two steps forward , it often feels we take one step back . But the long UNK of America has been UNK by forward UNK , a UNK UNK of our UNK UNK to UNK all , and not just some . ” Obama was not UNK denying the troubling person Atticus Finch may have become , just as he was not denying the country’s troubling situation now . But he was calling on America to UNK that the best version of UNK , and the best UNK of its UNK , UNK . </s>"
"<s> Donald Trump UNK , and UNK , the Press </s>","<s> Updated on January UNK at UNK UNK m. In his first press conference since UNK 2016 , Donald Trump took only a few questions but made news on several UNK , saying he UNK the UNK that Russia UNK UNK on top Democrats , UNK the press , and UNK once again to release his tax returns . Trump also refused to answer questions about whether any of his aides had been in UNK with Russian officials , though he later said they had not as he UNK the press conference . During the press conference , Trump announced a plan he said would answer concerns about conflicts of interest between the government and his business interests , UNK the UNK to an attorney to UNK the arrangement . The was in UNK mode , UNK reporters and the intelligence community and UNK several questions . He was asked early on about a UNK of stories that emerged Tuesday night — one , from CNN , saying that he had been briefed on a memo that said Russia agents claimed to have compromising information on him , and a UNK , from UNK , that UNK a UNK dossier of allegations . He UNK the publication of that dossier , and thanked news UNK that had not run it . “I read what was UNK , and I think it was a UNK , ” Trump said . He would not comment on whether he had been briefed on the UNK , saying briefings were UNK , but he said the allegations contained in the memo and dossier were UNK . But Trump said for the first time that he UNK the UNK had UNK the UNK against the Democratic National Committee and others , but he UNK that UNK action as just one of many . “As far as hacking I think it was Russia , but I think we also get UNK by other countries and other people , ” he said . ( He later added , in response to a UNK question , that it UNK been others also . ” ) Trump offered an ambiguous read on the publication of private UNK , on the one hand UNK the UNK of the dossier to the press — an action that he UNK , without UNK and UNK UNK , on the intelligence community — while at the same time UNK that the hacking of the UNK was bad but somewhat UNK because of the information it UNK . The refused to answer questions about whether any of his aides had been in UNK with Russian officials , as some UNK have stated . In an extremely UNK exchange , he UNK UNK questioning from UNK UNK UNK , saying , “You are UNK news . ” As he left the press conference , however , he UNK UNK UNK who UNK the question , saying , UNK . ” Trump insisted , despite UNK UNK to the UNK as well as his own UNK statements , that he did not and never had business dealings in Russia . When a UNK asked him whether he would release his taxes to UNK that , he once again UNK , UNK they are under audit . ( He has not UNK that claim , and the UNK says there’s UNK to UNK him from UNK taxes that are under audit . ) Yet he also seemed to suggest that having won the election , he no longer had any UNK to release the returns . “The only ones that care about my tax returns are the reporters , ” he said . “I mean , I won UNK I became president UNK ” ( A recent UNK UNK found that 60 percent of Americans would like Trump to make the UNK public . ) The details of Trump’s plan to UNK his conflicts of interest remain to be UNK and UNK , though he made several UNK UNK during the press conference . He UNK , UNK , that he has very little UNK . He claimed to have been offered a $ 2 billion deal in UNK over the UNK , but he said UNK UNK it down — even though , he said , he had no UNK to do so . “I could actually run my business and run the government at the same time , ” Trump said . He added , “I have a situation because I’m president . ” That’s an UNK UNK . While not all laws UNK to the president , the lack of legal UNK does not mean conflicts of interest can not exist . Moreover , Trump is still subject to the UNK UNK UNK , among other rules . UNK taking questions , Trump UNK about companies UNK new UNK in the U. S. or UNK planned UNK . UNK he claimed UNK , most of those decisions were made prior to his election . “I will be the UNK jobs producer that UNK ever created , and I mean that , ” he said . And Trump UNK to continue to UNK his UNK around . He thanked UNK that had UNK for him on UNK Day and seemed to suggest that those UNK would be UNK . He attacked UNK companies for UNK high prices , and said the federal government should UNK with them . UNK federal law bars such UNK for UNK . While Democrats have long UNK for greater UNK power , UNK this UNK could put the into conflict with UNK in UNK , who have UNK UNK . Yet as much as the event was a chance for the press to address Trump , it was also a UNK for Trump to address — and UNK down — the press .

I know this just UNK . UNK you UNK or comment on the fact that the intelligence community has presented this ? The question may have come from a comedian . Its UNK may have been UNK in UNK and UNK in a UNK easy UNK . The UNK exchange might have taken place amid all the UNK UNK of comedy . Still : UNK , and it looked an UNK lot like journalism . It UNK just Meyers’s UNK that Conway UNK or UNK on the CNN report . It was also his UNK of Conway’s own attempts to deflect his UNK . It was his question , in response to Conway’s UNK that UNK has UNK that Russia UNK in the 2016 election , “But shouldn’t we care if the UNK tried to interfere , whether it UNK the UNK of the election or not ? ” And it was his response , when Conway told him that Trump “has said that he is not UNK of UNK — the UNK in this case meaning , UNK , the briefings that were the subject of the CNN report — that the ’s lack of UNK UNK UNK . ” It was his further response , when Conway met Meyers’s note about Trump’s apparent lack of UNK in UNK the UNK of the Russian involvement in the election with UNK was UNK enough to figure out UNK : UNK a UNK right there , Kellyanne . ” ( He added : “And , by the way , no one does it better . ” ) That the UNK exchange would be UNK was , on the one hand , UNK UNK . Meyers , first of all , has made no UNK of his ( UNK ) UNK . His audience was UNK on his UNK in the UNK . And the questions he asked Conway took on the UNK they did in part because of the UNK UNK : The news of Trump’s being briefed about the compromising information , first reported by CNN , UNK right before Late Night UNK . But Meyers also took the UNK he did because of the UNK that have come to comedy in recent years — and , especially , within the most recent one . may once have offered an easy way for UNK to UNK with people and UNK themselves in the eyes of public , via UNK UNK , UNK UNK of UNK , and the like occasionally , it still does that .

And Meyers himself has also UNK out of his way to UNK the UNK UNK of comedy . As he put it during his UNK UNK the day after the 2016 presidential election , UNK Trump made a lot of UNK as to what he was going to do over the next four years , and now we get to see if he will , if he can , UNK them .

But despite his UNK UNK , the UNK president also had words of UNK , UNK about the important UNK between the country’s political UNK and its economic health . A UNK country , he suggested , is the UNK UNK to economic UNK . UNK , a UNK economy will UNK political polarization . They are UNK . UNK at where the economy stood when Obama took office in January of UNK , it’s UNK to UNK the progress that has been made . UNK , the economy is UNK again wages , UNK , home UNK , and retirement UNK are UNK again UNK is UNK again . The wealthy are UNK a UNK share of taxes even as the UNK market UNK records . The unemployment rate is near a low , ” Obama said . While many would UNK whether the tax code is UNK UNK , ” the fact that the UNK president UNK office during one of the UNK UNK in recent UNK and UNK an economy significantly UNK than he found it is a point of fact . As my colleague UNK UNK wrote , the final jobs report of the Obama UNK showed that he UNK over UNK months of UNK job UNK , a feat UNK many of his UNK — though one that was UNK UNK because the job loss UNK during the early years of his administration was so UNK . At the end of his UNK , the unemployment rate will UNK UNK 5 percent — half of where it was at the UNK of the UNK . And while there’s been much debate about the UNK of the jobs added , and criticism of the UNK UNK rate , in the last year of Obama’s UNK the economy showed a UNK of UNK : UNK UNK . But despite these UNK , the economy still shows UNK of UNK . And in his UNK speech Obama UNK the fact that many and Americans continue to struggle with UNK , UNK wages , and UNK UNK of living , even as a small portion of wealthy Americans UNK UNK . This UNK progress isn’t just UNK , it’s a threat to the UNK UNK of UNK and possibility that UNK UNK in the country , he suggested . UNK democracy won’t work without a sense that UNK has economic UNK , ” Obama said , UNK on inequality and social UNK , two issues that have been UNK again and again during his administration . In the UNK of Donald Trump’s election , one UNK help but UNK that this UNK inequality was a UNK of both UNK during the election . The UNK UNK it on Obama and UNK policies , a position that seems to have brought to the UNK a very specific UNK of white UNK , UNK by job loss and UNK economic UNK . Obama UNK to this UNK , if somewhat UNK , UNK the top one percent has UNK a bigger share of UNK and UNK , too many UNK , in UNK UNK and UNK UNK , have been left behind — the UNK worker the UNK and health care worker who struggle to pay the UNK — UNK that the game is UNK against them , that their government only serves the interests of the UNK — a UNK for more UNK and polarization in our UNK , ” he said . In these statements , Obama attempted to UNK the UNK between Americans who share the UNK of economic UNK but remain UNK within the UNK by UNK , UNK , UNK , and political UNK . But more than a UNK between the groups , Obama’s statements also contained a UNK for those UNK by Trump’s UNK to bring back jobs in UNK America and the UNK UNK — those who feel that they would still be UNK UNK if not for Democratic policies . “The next UNK of economic UNK won’t come from UNK .

<s> The Trump UNK UNK of UNK : A UNK UNK </s>,"<s> With confirmation hearings beginning , attention is UNK UNK UNK from Trump and toward those who may make up his administration . Like the under whom they may soon be serving , many of Trump’s nominees have been UNK from the UNK UNK of the business community or are otherwise political UNK . UNK like Trump , many of them have come under significant UNK for how their UNK may lead to conflicts of interest with the roles they are UNK to serve . These are especially UNK because , UNK during the UNK to previous UNK , it appears that this UNK confirmation hearings will UNK before the Office of Government UNK has had UNK time to UNK UNK UNK . This UNK UNK UNK of events goes against the explicit UNK of the Director of the OGE , who wrote in a letter to the UNK Democratic UNK that he is UNK UNK of any UNK in the four decades since OGE was UNK when the UNK has UNK a confirmation UNK before the nominee has UNK the ethics UNK and UNK , “For as long as I UNK Director , UNK staff and agency ethics officials will not UNK to UNK to UNK UNK and ignore conflicts of interest . ” ( UNK of note is a letter from current UNK Majority UNK UNK UNK , who in UNK sent Majority UNK UNK UNK a letter UNK his UNK for UNK UNK UNK but is now questioning the UNK of those calling for the same for Trump’s nominees . ) Moreover , in UNK with the rules for the president , there are both explicit rules UNK conflicts of interest for appointed officials and a long history of appointed officials UNK their UNK for personal financial UNK . With UNK to the former , the law UNK an UNK branch UNK from UNK UNK and UNK in a UNK Government matter that will affect his own financial UNK or those of his family members , a general UNK , or any UNK with whom he or she UNK as an officer , UNK , UNK , general UNK , or UNK or may one day be UNK . UNK could UNK in UNK time of up to five years , a UNK of up to $ 50 , 000 , or both investigations into alleged UNK fall under the UNK of the UNK Department . For the UNK , UNK the most UNK example of UNK UNK in their personal financial interests is the UNK UNK UNK of the UNK , in which UNK UNK UNK Secretary of the Interior UNK UNK was UNK of UNK UNK in UNK the UNK for oil UNK in UNK and UNK . The administration of UNK S. UNK , UNK , was UNK by UNK in UNK federal UNK , UNK from UNK speculation in the State Department to UNK for UNK UNK , to the UNK UNK UNK , which led to the UNK of UNK UNK of UNK UNK and his personal secretary . In recent decades , more than 100 of UNK UNK UNK , including Attorney UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK of UNK Michael UNK , were UNK for financial UNK , leading to numerous UNK and UNK . During the Obama administration , UNK accused Steven UNK , who served in UNK roles in the Department of UNK , of inappropriately UNK for a $ UNK million UNK guarantee for the UNK company UNK while his wife UNK at a law firm UNK the company . Even more recently , allegations of conflicts of interest were UNK UNK to the 2016 presidential campaign , in which Trump repeatedly accused Hillary UNK of inappropriately UNK her office as Secretary of State with her UNK foundation . UNK to all of these concerns is the fact that Trump’s family members appear likely to have a UNK role in his administration than a UNK family has had in any administration since John F. UNK UNK of his brother as Attorney UNK led to the creation of laws . Ivanka Trump , for example , is UNK to take on many of the duties typically expected of a First UNK , and has UNK in on at least one of her father’s meeting with a her adult UNK , Donald Jr. and Eric , are members of their father’s transition team and often seen as among his closest UNK , although it remains unclear what , if any , official roles they will take on in his administration . And Trump’s Jared Kushner , whom many UNK will be one of the ’s top advisers once he takes office , has and UNK interests of his own that could UNK with his official duties . As my colleague UNK UNK noted , the question with conflicts of interest is not if , but when and how much they will affect UNK . UNK into UNK who UNK UNK from UNK companies — often as apparently UNK as a UNK or UNK — shows that UNK small UNK can change UNK UNK by UNK UNK how a UNK UNK the company behind the UNK . As such , The UNK will be UNK our UNK of Trump’s conflicts of interests to include those expected to serve in his administration . UNK is the current UNK of Trump’s UNK administration members , official and otherwise , whose actions or financial entanglements have UNK concerns over conflicts of interest . UNK the law requires most UNK for UNK to UNK such questions before UNK office , some have already taken the steps UNK to mitigate conflicts of interest these steps will be noted as UNK . The most recent UNK appear at the top : Trump’s UNK UNK , Though Trump has not — in fact , can not — appointed any members of his UNK family to a UNK in his administration , it UNK appears that they will likely have significant UNK in his administration . According to numerous UNK , Trump’s UNK UNK , Ivanka , is likely to take on a policy UNK roughly on UNK with that of a UNK first UNK just what it will UNK is not yet known , although UNK on meetings she has taken since the election with UNK UNK and UNK UNK , UNK change has UNK as a possibility . UNK , according to UNK , her husband , Jared Kushner , will be serving as a UNK adviser to the president . And though Trump’s adult sons , Donald Jr. and Eric , apparently will not be serving in any official UNK within their father’s administration , they are nonetheless widely seen as among his closest UNK and are members of his transition team . UNK , Trump’s three UNK children’s UNK to the has created significant conflicts of interest . ( Trump’s other adult UNK , UNK , does not appear likely to be part of the administration . ) UNK of this UNK around their father’s UNK UNK to UNK issues with his UNK UNK by UNK his assets into a trust that will be UNK by Donald Jr. and Eric . As I have previously written , though Trump and his supporters have referred to the plan he has described as a blind trust ( or , more recently , a “ trust , ” which is a thing that doesn’t exist ) the children’s role as advisers to their father means they don’t have nearly enough UNK to UNK a true blind trust . ( And since so much of Trump’s business UNK from real UNK and his personal UNK , even a real blind trust would not be UNK to UNK concerns about conflicts of interest , as he will retain his UNK of what those assets are ) . UNK , since Trump’s election , Ivanka , Donald Jr. and Eric have all been UNK in meetings that UNK even the UNK of distance from their father’s political dealings . UNK three appeared in UNK of a UNK between their father and the UNK of numerous UNK companies , as well as a meeting with the and his Indian business UNK . Ivanka and her husband UNK in on a meeting between their father and the Japanese UNK UNK UNK UNK , even though Ivanka was at the time UNK a UNK deal with a company UNK in part by the Japanese government . Donald Jr. and Eric , who the has decided will run the business in his UNK , have both UNK meetings on their father’s UNK . Along with the problems , all three have UNK criticism for allegedly selling access to the administration through their companies or UNK UNK . After Ivanka appeared on 60 UNK , her company sent out an UNK for the $ 10 , 000 UNK that she UNK on UNK . On UNK UNK , the Eric Trump UNK UNK an UNK UNK for a chance to have a meeting over UNK with Ivanka as criticism UNK , the foundation UNK the UNK UNK , though not before the UNK UNK more than $ 70 , 000 . And both Eric and Donald Jr. were involved in a planned , but UNK UNK , UNK UNK UNK for the day after their father takes office whose UNK could pay up to $ 1 million for a private UNK with the as well as a UNK trip with one of his two sons . In the aftermath , Trump announced that Eric would be UNK down his foundation to UNK further speculation . UNK , Jared Kushner’s business entanglements also create conflicts with his expected role in the Trump administration . First and UNK , some ethics UNK believe that his involvement will trip federal laws that have been in place since after John F. UNK named his brother UNK to the UNK of attorney general , although Trump’s and Kushner’s lawyers have UNK otherwise . On January 7 , just two days before Trump’s transition team UNK that Kushner would UNK be taking a position , The New York Times reported that he has been UNK a deal with the Chinese financial UNK UNK UNK to UNK UNK UNK UNK , a UNK of his holdings . Kushner’s brother , UNK Kushner , is a of the UNK UNK UNK , which could stand to make millions off of the potential UNK of the UNK market should Trump pursue UNK and UNK the UNK UNK UNK . According to The New York Times , Kushner’s lawyer has said that he is taking several steps to mitigate conflicts of interest . These include getting UNK of his UNK UNK and his stake in the New York UNK , selling many of his assets to his brother , UNK a family trust to be UNK by his UNK , and UNK from his role as chief UNK of Kushner UNK . Though Kushner is so far taking more active steps than his has , problems remain . As is the case with Trump’s UNK trust , having a family member UNK a trust does not create nearly enough UNK to make it UNK blind . Moreover , like the ’s business , many of Kushner’s assets are simply UNK over their UNK doesn’t UNK Kushner’s UNK UNK of what will affect their UNK , even if he says he will recuse himself from decisions that may affect them . In other words , as with his conflicts of interest will remain UNK Kushner takes more UNK steps to distance himself from UNK of UNK that could UNK his in the White House . Back to table of contents , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , After UNK of speculation and apparent interest in several more UNK UNK , Trump eventually UNK on Rex Tillerson , the CEO of ExxonMobil , as his nominee for Secretary of State . Though Tillerson , who has a net worth in the UNK of millions , is actually among the less wealthy of Trump’s nominees , his position as head of the world’s largest publicly UNK UNK company has led to questions as to whether he will be UNK to fully UNK his business interests from his official duties . As is the case with the he is expected to serve , much of the UNK over Tillerson UNK to his apparently UNK UNK relationship with Vladimir Putin . In fact , according to Steven UNK UNK on the company , UNK UNK : ExxonMobil and American UNK , the relationship , which UNK in Tillerson UNK an UNK called “the Russian UNK of UNK from Putin , was a key reason Tillerson was UNK as the company’s CEO in 2006 . UNK UNK , the head of the UNK affairs UNK in the UNK UNK of Russian UNK , UNK in on Tillerson’s nomination on Twitter UNK after it was announced , calling the nomination “a UNK . ” Along with his UNK to Putin , Tillerson’s nomination has UNK concerns because of UNK complicated relationship with the U. S. government . According to the UNK Times , while Tillerson was in charge of the company , Exxon UNK UNK UNK with the Russian oil company UNK — whose chief , UNK UNK , is considered a member of UNK UNK UNK — to UNK UNK in the UNK UNK , UNK , and the UNK UNK . These UNK UNK , however , when the UNK UNK UNK the Russian oil industry in response to the country’s UNK of UNK in 2014 . As could be expected for a person in his position , Tillerson was an active UNK of the U. UNK sanctions UNK the process after all , the sanctions have UNK Exxon from moving forward with UNK reported to be worth billions of UNK . That Tillerson has publicly UNK the UNK of sanctions — and has made at least five UNK to the White House since Obama UNK the sanctions — is in a sense UNK from his role with Exxon . As Secretary of State , he will have significant UNK over those sanctions , which means that he could UNK pursue a policy that would make his former company billions . So far , Tillerson has taken a UNK of steps to comply with rules . According to CNN , Tillerson will be selling off his more than UNK , 000 shares in Exxon — UNK valued at more than $ UNK million — before taking office . In UNK , rather than UNK Tillerson his expected retirement package ( 2 million Exxon shares , valued at more than $ UNK million , over the next UNK ) the company will put the UNK of the retirement package into a blind trust that will not be allowed to UNK in the oil company . And should Tillerson UNK to work in the industry in the next 10 years , he would UNK the UNK UNK . He is also expected to recuse himself from any UNK that may affect his former company for his first two years in office . Tillerson’s UNK UNK something of a UNK for future UNK as well as UNK for Trump himself . Though Tillerson , like Trump , has yet to respond to UNK to release his tax returns , he has created an arrangement by which his previous entanglements are UNK remote that he can UNK say they no longer UNK a conflict of interest . Back to table of contents , Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross , Wilbur Ross , Trump’s UNK to lead the Department of Commerce , is one of several wealthy UNK in Trump’s UNK UNK . Ross , who Trump called “a UNK of American UNK and UNK of the UNK UNK I have met , ” is a billionaire UNK who made much of his UNK by UNK and UNK UNK companies , including those in the steel , UNK , and UNK UNK . Along the way , Ross had a UNK of UNK jobs and UNK UNK for workers at the companies that he took over , as well as for a 2006 UNK at a UNK operated by a company he UNK . Ross’s financial holdings also create significant conflicts of interest that he will have to UNK before he UNK office . For example , Ross has a stake in , and UNK on the UNK of , ArcelorMittal , the world’s largest steel producer , a company that UNK has a major stake in the Commerce UNK UNK of the steel industry , including its UNK of UNK , UNK , and tariffs . In fact , according to UNK , during the first 100 days of Trump’s administration , the Commerce Department is likely to be UNK on investigations into UNK UNK of steel UNK from UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK , all of which could significantly affect UNK UNK and UNK prices . Ross is also a UNK UNK of the UNK of UNK , where he served UNK UNK UNK , a Russian UNK who Putin recently UNK in charge of a major UNK to bring jobs to Russia and who was once accused of UNK UNK to take control of a UNK oil UNK . Though Ross has stated that he UNK to step down from his position , his UNK firm , UNK Ross UNK will retain its stake in the UNK . UNK the specific entanglements UNK ArcelorMittal , Ross’s job as Secretary of Commerce would give him UNK to UNK his general interests in the steel industry : UNK he not only steps down from his position at ArcelorMittal but also UNK his stake in the company , Ross will be UNK off of any UNK by his own department that makes the company more UNK . As was noted during the campaign after it was reported that Trump used Chinese steel in some of his UNK UNK , the Department of Commerce recently UNK a probe into the Chinese steel UNK UNK of American tariffs and use of a UNK UNK , in which the Chinese companies UNK the American industry by UNK the market with their UNK at an UNK low UNK . As Trump’s UNK secretary , Ross would be in charge of UNK the probe and UNK a UNK moving forward , which could be done in a way that makes his own holdings more UNK . So far , UNK of Trump and Ross have UNK these concerns by UNK Ross’s situation to that of UNK UNK , the billionaire UNK who has served in the role under President Obama since 2013 . In order to comply with the Office of Government UNK rules , UNK UNK off her stake in more than UNK companies and UNK from her position with UNK Ross could UNK do the same and put his UNK assets in a blind trust . UNK he does so , his billions in holdings and industry involvement could UNK , or at the very least be seen as UNK , his in office . Back to table of contents , Secretary of Labor Andy Puzder , Andy Puzder , Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Labor , is one of Trump’s many nominees with a history of UNK toward the very UNK he will soon be leading . As the CEO of CKE UNK , which UNK the chains UNK Jr. and UNK , Puzder developed a long UNK UNK of UNK to and UNK rules and policies he also UNK the UNK policies under President Obama and current UNK UNK UNK as UNK by UNK enforcement . ” Along with his UNK toward the department , Puzder would bring to the position significant financial entanglements that could UNK his UNK to UNK his duties in office . UNK the Department of UNK duties is UNK claims of UNK and UNK safety UNK . chains are UNK UNK of such claims during UNK UNK at CKE , the Labor Department UNK allegations of UNK UNK and other problems at several Hardee’s franchises , finding UNK in nearly 60 UNK of UNK . UNK UNK is the fact that such actions typically UNK the individual UNK rather than UNK companies like CKE . According to UNK , of the UNK investigations into UNK since UNK , only UNK were at UNK , UNK of which UNK a UNK UNK . When Puzder first emerged as a possible UNK for the position , a source close to him suggested that , since UNK percent of Hardee’s and UNK Jr. UNK are franchises not UNK operated by CKE , Puzder may not have to recuse himself from his company in order to UNK out his duties as Secretary of Labor . UNK , as is true for the himself , simply being UNK in the UNK of a UNK UNK does not UNK conflicts of interest . The UNK is not UNK UNK of control over CKE and its individual franchises but the fact that he makes UNK off of a company that UNK comes into conflict with the very department that he will soon be UNK , which could create UNK UNK to pursue policies against the interests of the company’s UNK or the general public . As such , it remains an UNK question how Puzder will distance himself from CKE to avoid the possibility that his role with the company will interfere with his potential role in the Trump administration .

UNK federal obligations to offer a diverse UNK that UNK the Havasupai UNK and UNK , the suit contends , the school doesn’t even UNK UNK UNK reading and math .

UNK rates on UNK are among the UNK of all UNK UNK — the UNK rate for Native American students UNK is just UNK percent . At BIE schools , it’s UNK percent .
